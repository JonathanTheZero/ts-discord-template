# TypeScript Discord Bot Tempalte

This repository serves as a personal template for my Discord bots. 
They are coded using the Discord.js API and TypeScript.


All the needed dependencies are saved in the `package.json` file, simply type `npm i` in the command line while in this directory and you are ready to go.
